## Learning objectives
The key learning objective from this workshop could be simply summarised as:

_Provide basic tools to develop PINNs for solving various differential models._

More specifically we aim to:

 - provide an understanding of the applications of PINNs as presented in the literature,
 - introduce the differences and comparisons between traditional neural networks (NN) and physics-informed neural networks (PINNs),
 - explore the formulation and solution of direct and inverse problems using PINNs in 1D and 2D models, and
 - discuss advanced practices and techniques in developing and optimizing PINNs.

With regards to specific PINNs content we cover:

 - reviewing key case studies and applications in scientific literature,
 - understanding differences between NN and PINNs,
 - implementing and solving both direct and inverse problems in 1D and 2D scenarios,
 - applying advanced techniques for improving PINN performance and accuracy
